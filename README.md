# Checkout : process review

During a process review with a peer, I TTD'd this <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review/exercises/checkout">checkout exercise</a> following the instructions below and in the <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review/exercises/checkout">link</a>.

#### Instructions:
In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we'll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually.<br>
In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and they'll cost you y pounds.
<br>
#### Our price table and offers:
```
+------+-------+----------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers |
+------+-------+----------------+
| A    | 50    | 3A for 130     |
| B    | 30    | 2B for 45      |
| C    | 20    |                |
| D    | 15    |                |
+------+-------+----------------+
```
Notes: For any illegal input (non capitals) simply return -1
